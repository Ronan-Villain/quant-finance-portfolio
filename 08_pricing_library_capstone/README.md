# Pricing Library Capstone

End-to-end implementation of a small, modular pricing library
bringing together market data, curves, instruments, pricing engines
and risk measures.

## Objective
Demonstrate the ability to design a clean pricing architecture similar
to what is used on a quant desk.

## Features
- Market data abstraction
- Yield curve construction
- Instrument definitions
- Pricing engines
- Risk (Greeks) computation

## Philosophy
- Separation of concerns
- Reusability
- Numerical robustness
